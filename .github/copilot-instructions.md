# Rules

- always use official docs, use context7 tools/skills
- always prefer the practices of any library or framework, no manual workaround just to develop or solve anything.
- 100% code coverage is required. Never ever skip this crucial success factor in any work.
- always cover all changes by tests and validate them all by running. Nothing is worse than slop code.
- use skills in developing the features. They will give you the relevant best practices of the framework or library
- always make detailed research on the web before taking any design or implementation decision. You can use the web to find the best practices, patterns, and solutions for the problem at hand.
- always update the documentation and readme files to reflect the changes you made.
- always try finishing all the work in one go. Do not leave any work half done.
- always use Claude Opus 4.6 parallel subagents to be fast and efficient.
- always work in parallel by using the unlimited Claude Opus 4.6 parallel subagents.
- always be responsible for the project and its code quality. "None of these are caused by my changes." is not an acceptable answer. If you see any issues, fix them.
- always learn from your mistakes. And update the rules under lessons section. This is as important as implementing the features.

## Lessons

- Nextjs now uses proxy instead of middleware. Middleware is deprecated.
